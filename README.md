[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/499457091526721538.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/499457091526721538)

Morphobot is a Discord bot written with the discord.js library and built on the Klasa framework.
Providing a plethora of reliable commands for server owners and users, Morphobot aims to be the only bot server owners will need in their Discord server. Not only does Morphobot have a structured settings, commands, and permissions system, we also provide tools that assist server staff and users in their daily usage and conversations, such as the userinfo, avatar, and remindme commands. We also provide fun commands, such as fml and yomomma.

Initiated on the 10th of November 2018, this current version is a revive of the old, shutdown Morphobot,
but this time back with faster command response times, easier handling and more reliability thanks to the Klasa framework.
Morphobot is owned by `Morphoxeris#1111`.

# Morphobot
Morphobot is a discord.js bot written on the Klasa framework.

Initiated on the 10th of November 2018, this current version is a revive of the old, shutdown Morphobot,
but this time back with faster command response times, easier handling and more reliability thanks to the Klasa frammework.
Morphobot is owned by `Morphoxeris#1111`.
